This is a port of Clone-Keen. Please refer to readme_clonekeen for original readme file. Clone-Keen was done in legacy SDL. I have spent considerable time porting it to SDL2. It's still far from complete though.

Right now, you can boot the game on switch and play. However, some things don't work:
	1) I still need to work on making sound work. Right now you have to mute the switch (unless you want to listen to a very unpleasent buzz). 
	2) Other than that, I haven't tested button rebinding, it's likely not functional right now. 
	3) The editor likely doesn't work and may never (not a piority of mine).

Please be patient, this is the first port I am working on and I'm learning a lot through trial and error. It's definitely very different than making games!

The release only comes with the first shareware episode so don't expect to play all three episodes unless you can acquire somehow.
